# Good quotes:
- Forget about the past, focus on your present, your future will be safe and secure.
- Good things take time
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- The one you're looking for might already be here.
- Read between the lines.
- Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people who treat you right and forget about the ones who don't
- Silence the angry man with love. Silce the ill-natured man with kindness. Silence the miser with generosity. Silence the liar with truth.
- Cry. Forgive. Learn. Move on. Let your tears water the seeds of your future happniness.
- Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain, because life's greatest lessons are learnt through pain.
- Ask yourself if what you are doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow.
- I am too positive to be doubtful, too optimistic to be fearful, and too determined to be defeated.
- Believe the you deseve all the good and it will find you.
- Choose your circle carefully. Spend time with people who belong in your future not those who should stay in your past.
- Switch your metality from "I'm broken and helpless" to "I'm growing and healing" and watch how your life changes, for the better.
